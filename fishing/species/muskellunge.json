	"fishing_techniques": "River fishermen use small boats with electric motors or small outboards to float larger pools and fish shoreline snags and submerged brush. Heavy bait casting rods and reels with 30+ lb. test line is used. Using large hooks, 4/0 or larger, some anglers simply allow 8 or 12-inch suckers, shad or carp to swim free.\\nMuskies are commonly caught in lakes by trolling deep water with large crankbaits, spoons andspinner-bucktail combinations. Early in the year, try trolling across shallow points."
