# Open Hunting and Fishing Data

Hunting and fishing is a $75 billion/year business in the United States. 33 million people fish regularly, and 14 million people hunt regularly. (It's important to non-hunters, tooâ€”state conservation efforts are funded largely by hunting and fishing license fees.)

This project will render many hunting and fishing regulations as machine-readable data, in partnership with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. See the [issues list](https://github.com/USODI/Hunting-and-Fishing/issues/) to see the work that is now underway.

This is a collaborative project. Comments, ideas, concerns, and contributions are welcome from absolutely anybody.
